                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
                            personal information relates to you.

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>

                            reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
                            information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
                        </p>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that
                            the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

                            <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                            <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result </strong>in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any
                            CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial
                            incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
