# Blue Social Web3

Welcome to the Blue Social Web3 Public repository! This project aims to incorporate Web3 functionalities into the existing Blue Social iOS Web2 app, allowing users to earn rewards through real-life social interactions using the innovative Proof-of-Interaction (POI) protocol. Our platform fosters meaningful connections and engagement through a Socialize-to-Earn model.

- The Swift code is private due to IP of Follow-Mee, inc. and shareholders.
- The POI protocol will be public early 2025 to allow developers and builders to build apps on top of it.
