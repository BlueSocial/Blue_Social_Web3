# Blue Social Web3

Welcome to the Blue Social Web3 Public repository! This project aims to incorporate Web3 functionalities into the existing Blue Social iOS Web2 app, allowing users to earn rewards through real-life social interactions using the innovative Proof-of-Interaction (POI) protocol. Our platform fosters meaningful connections and engagement through a Socialize-to-Earn model.

As Will from @Base told us to share, here is what we had prior to buildathon:
- The Swift BLE code is hidden due to IP of Follow-Mee, inc. and shareholders. (Pre-Built)
- Most of the Native iOS app was built previously before Buildathon in Swift.

 And what we built during buildathon:
- We removed a lot of features and built an MVP Web3 version that is on Base during buildathon using React Native components.
- We built smart contracts for the BLUE token, Exchange Contact & Proof-of-Interaction during BASE buildathon.
- We built a rewardUser function that rewards users with tokens after a IRL social interaction.
- We built a PHP backend to talk to Thirdweb Engine during Base buildathon.
- We built a way to show users wallet balance in app of BLUE Sepolia Tokens.
- We built Thirdweb in-app wallets for sign up and sign in.
- We built smart accounts/wallets for users, sponsoring gas fees.
- We built website below and integrated Thirdweb Pay to allow users to buy tokens with credit card / crypto.
